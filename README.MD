# LED Wolf Mask

A C++ program that drives animated lighting patterns on an LED matrix mounted to a wolf head mask. It runs on an Arduino Uno microcontroller and uses the FastLED and JC_Button libraries. There is a button that cycles through LED brightness options and another button that cycles through different patterns. 

## The mask in action!

Switching between patterns.
1. Rainbow
2. Blending between two gradients (sunset and ice blue)
